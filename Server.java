However for this project since the server has to handle incoming connections and also handle user input simultaneously, we start a separate thread to listen for incoming connections in the Server. This is the ServerSocketHandler thread, which will in turn spawn new Connection Threads, for each client connection.

    // add other methods as necessaryu. For example, you will prbably need a method to print the incoming connection info.
